		PES 240709 Our PB Air pollution / Aerosol loading boundary comes out very big… \
		while in the latest PB update 
		(Richardson 2023 https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458) the PB Aerosol \
		loading is in the green zone.
		So they put their proxy (AOD) for PB Aerosol loading current value to 0,08 and the \
		planetary boundary/red zone threshold to 0,1, 
		in other words still in the green, while with our estimate it is at  400% above the \
		green level (in 2020, and in our TLTL more or less stable to 2100).
		
		I propose we do a quick fix here, by just changing the threshold variable pb Urban \
		aerosol concentration green threshold from its current 10 to a higher 
		threshold, let’s say 20.  That stops the aerosol overloading from dominating the \
		entire planetary health average. 
		Please make a comment in the formula for the variable, with a date, so we \
		remember why we did it.

	Heat in atmosphere current to initial ratio,
		([(0,0)-(1,1)],(0,0),(0.16,0.85),(0.5,1),(1,1) ))
	~	dimensionless
	~	Melting is modeled as a function of surface temp, but the heat to melt ice \
		comes mostly from the atmosphere (only floating arctic ice is partially \
		melted through heat in the upper ocean). Since the atmospheric heat \
		reservoir is very tiny, there needs to be an effect from that reservoir to \
		limit melting if and when the reservoir is close to being depleted, for \
		whatever reason. One reason could be the large scale experimental (in this \
		model) release of methane hydrates.

	~	dimensionless
	~	If the earth is mostly covered in ice, additional freezing stops. This is \
		a crutch due to the way we drew the system boundaries. In reality, water \

		finally increase the volume of ice.

	~	Again, a crutch to prevent more area to be covered by sea ice than the \

		to a significantly colder earth and in order not to get tripped up by \

		"Terrestrial Sink" gives the numbers for the "land". While it lists 9 \

		residual (col B) that is close, but not identical, to the mean value of \

		http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/4/333/2013/esd-4-333-2013.html and found, \

		in the Excel sheet. The other experiments are dropped. Thus, at the very \

Area equivalent of 1km linear retreat km2=

		assumed area of permafrost (of 25 Mkm2), the outer ring needs a diamter of \
		about 3500 km. Second, we assume that permafrost melting occurs from the \
		outer radius linearly inwards. Simple calculations result that a retreat \

		km2 and at the inner ring an area of about 13 000 km2. Averaging (which is \

	~	This odd variable is meant to capture the fact that heat not only diffuses \

		that physical process in the required detail (partly because the physics \

		down and upwelling to change so we need to introduce this effect in a \

		that altitude should be set to 17km looking down, by default the model on \
		the site looks down from 70km: "The main reason for that is in the \
		influence of stratosphere. Radiative forcing is defined as a change in the \
		flux just above troposphere after stratospheric temperatures have reached \
		the new radiative energy balance, i.e., after the stratosphere has cooled. \
		UChicago MODTRAN does not allow for cooling stratosphere. Results \
		calculated at 17 km looking down are closer to the correct ones, but fully \
		correct values require a model that makes the stratospheric corrections." \

For the policy sliders Sergio *might* need them to be Auxiliaries / Gaming even though they are only constants. For me it does not matter, except if I set them to Auxiliaries / Gaming I cannot change them during SynTheSim.|<<NnN>>|Hence I put all policy sliders here as shadow variables, so I can switch back and forth with relative ease.
